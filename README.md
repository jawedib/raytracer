# C++ Ray Tracer

A C++ ray tracer with the focus on rendering realistic images at low CPU cost regardless of the amount of dynamic lighting in the scenery.

As of 30th April 2019, adding a light to any scene costs a fraction of a second of processing time instead of doubling it. The challenge I am looking to overcome right now is for realistic light and shadow interaction as shining a new light source on a pre-existing shadow does not produce realistic results.
